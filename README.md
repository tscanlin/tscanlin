# Tim Scanlin

> I like to build things.

Currently I live in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Oakland,+CA/" target="_blank">Oakland, CA</a> and work as a senior frontend engineer.

I enjoy creating websites and applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in addition to contributing to <a href="https://github.com/tscanlin/" target="_blank">open source projects</a>. Sometimes I also write articles on my <a href="https://blog.timscanlin.net/" target="_blank">blog</a>.

In my free time I enjoy riding my bike, kayaking, hiking, playing board games, doing yoga, and making stuff with LEDs.
